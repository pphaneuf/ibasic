iBASIC
======

iBASIC is an attempt to build a BASIC interpreter that meets the
following criteria:

* Reject some of BASIC's worst syntax.
* Attempt to regularise the types available to allow easier integration with C.
* Aim for acceptable performance.
* Retain as much of BASIC's simplistic charm as possible.
* Try to incorporate some modern language features, eg. structures and types.

It is loosely based around BBC BASIC, which I used whilst I was growing up
and learning how to program computers. It is not intended to be a drop in
replacement.

I am attempting to document the thought processes behind the project as much
as anything else, in the hope that others wishing to learn about language
design and implementation might find them useful.

I hope you find it as useful / enjoyable as I am finding it to write.

PS. The name is derived from my own. iBASIC means "Ian's BASIC".
PPS. STFU, Apple Inc. :-)
